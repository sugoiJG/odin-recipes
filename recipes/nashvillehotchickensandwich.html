    <p>As you would expect, Nashville hot chicken is fried chicken with a major kick. The chicken gets a hefty dose of spice thanks to hot sauce and cayenne in the coating as well as a spicy sauce drizzled over the top. This version of fried chicken is served up with white bread and pickles to help balance out the heat.</p>
